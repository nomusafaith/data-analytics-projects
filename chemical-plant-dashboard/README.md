# Chemical Plant Dashboard Demo

This is a **Power BI demo dashboard** showcasing the importance of **data modeling** in a chemical engineering scenario.  

It includes:
- KPI cards for Production, Energy, Safety Incidents, Downtime, and Temperature
- Gauges for Temperature and Pressure
- Safety incident breakdown Pie Chart
- Downtime by Plant Bar Chart
- Energy vs Production Combo Chart
- DAX measures for totals, averages, and targets

This project was especially meaningful because I transitioned from being a **Chemical Engineer** to a **Data Engineer**, and it demonstrates how process thinking translates into **data modeling and visualization**.

## Data

The dashboard uses **mock chemical plant data** for production, energy, temperature, pressure, downtime, and safety incidents. The dataset is included in `data/chemical_plant_data.csv`.

## How to Use

1. Open `pbix/Chemical_Plant_Dashboard.pbix` in **Power BI Desktop**.
2. Load the sample dataset from `data/chemical_plant_data.csv`.
3. Explore KPIs, gauges, and supporting visuals.
4. Modify or extend the dashboard for your own scenarios.

## DAX Measures 

A separate file `DAX_measures.md` includes all measures used for KPIs and visualizations.

## Lessons Highlighted

- The importance of **data modeling** for establishing clear relationships
- Translating **chemical engineering processes** into actionable data insights
- Building **interactive dashboards** for decision making
